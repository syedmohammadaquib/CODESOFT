# CODESOFT

As part of my internship at CodSoft, I created a landing page using HTML and CSS. For novice web developers, a landing page is an excellent choice 🌱. It necessitates a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. This project will teach you how to build columns, separate sections, organize objects, and include headers and footers 📚. The most crucial part is to use your imagination to create an eye-catching page 🎨.

Pay attention to alignments, padding, color schemes, boxes, and other aspects 🔍. Avoid overlapping components with CSS 🛠️. In brief, a landing page project allows you to employ your HTML and CSS abilities, which encourages creativity while maintaining a visually beautiful and user-friendly layout 📈.
